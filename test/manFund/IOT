Device Layer: Consist of various devices like sensors, wearables, smart meters, smartphones, drones...etc and huge set of standard and custom communication protocol like ZigBee, BACNet, LLRP, Mobdus

Data Ingestion and transformation: Data from different data layer transformed to standard format for further processing by data processing layer
    This data could be from sensors, actuators, wearable, RFID received via TCP/IP socket communication or messaging queues like MQTT,AMPQ, CoAP, DDS, KAfka and HTTP/HTTPS over rest API
    
Data processing layer: batch processing of transformed data from device layer to perform image,preventive, and predictive analysis

APPlication layer: 

##Chalenges
1) Dynamic Environment: millons of sensors and different devices connection with the softwares and cloud

2) Real time complexity: IOT applicaitons can have multiple real time scenarios and its usecases are extremely complex

3) Scalability of systems: to create an envrionment for test ..to test functional and non functional aspects is real challenging

4) Complex set of usecases to create test cases and test data

5) security and privacy

6) safety concerns


Types of testing:

Functional Testing:
Compatibility Testing: device versions, communication protoocl version, os version, device software version
Usablity Testing:
Network Testing:testing on different kind of internet connection
Security Testing:
Performance Testing:testing with device low battery, differenct memory configuration
Service Testing:IOT app web service testing
Operational Testing: TO verify app behavour when its fully charged or updated or misscall or network down
