Encapsulation-> hiding implementation behind public programming interface

Inheritance is for 1) code reuse 2) polymorphism

class A{ }

Class C{}

class B extend A{ private C animal; }

B extends A => B IS-A A B HAS-A C

Every class in java is subclass of object class

class cant extend more than one class( Deadly diamond of Dead)
