Abstraction
Encapsulation
Polymorphism: compile time and run time.
Inheritance
Association
Composition
Aggregation

* Abstraction is to hide the implementation and expose only which is meaningful and simple...like exposing object methods but leave the details in its implementation

* encapsulation is implementation of abstraction. using access modifiers public private protrected etc it is also for controlling access to an object

* compile time polymorphism is method overloading and runtime polymorphism is method overiding as it is at runtime when the compiler decides

* inhertance is implemented by extending a class(ex parent and child class) to promote code reuse

* association is when objects can exist independently of each other and can have one to one or one to many relation ship. like teacher and students objects are also independent of each other. No ownership is involved

* Aggregation owner ship is involved so object also have HAS-A relation ship.

* composition is when object can not existe without other like house and room object
